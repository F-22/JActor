# JActor

JActor is a high-throughput Java Actor framework, one of the fastest Actor implementations in any language.
*   Two-way messages provide implicit flow control, for better performance under load.
*   A simple machine builder is included to help keep application code clear and simple.
*   A billion actors a second can be created on a single thread.

1.  [The Problem with Actors](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/jactor/entry/the_problem_with_actors56)

     Actor-based programming is quite appealing and holds a lot of potential. ...

1.  [Introducing JActor](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/jactor/entry/introducing_jactor4)

     Vertical scaling is today a major issue when writing server code. Threads and locks are the traditional approach to
     making full utilization of fat (multi-core) computers, but result is code that is difficult to maintain and which to
     often does not run much faster than single-threaded code. ...

1.  [JActor API Basics](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/jactor/entry/jactor_api_basics17)

    Here we cover the basic API of JActor, which is very easy to use as you will see from the examples provided. ...

1.  [Exception Handling made Easy](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/jactor/entry/exception_handling_made_easy4)

    Message passing between threads and callbacks can both make exception handling more difficult. On the other hand,
    the use of 2-way messages (request/response) provides us with a natural default: uncaught exceptions should be
    passed back to the requesting actor for handling. And that is exactly what JActor does. ...

1.  [A Bi-Modal Iterator for JActor](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/jactor/entry/a_bi_modal_iterator_for_jactor6)

    Loops are usually just a while loop with a hasNext() method in the condition and a next() method in the body. But
    when the response to these methods is asynchronous the loop fails, because the response is not received until after
    the while loop has completed. ...

1.  [The Simple Machines of JActor](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/jactor/entry/the_simple_machines_of_jactor4)

    When multiple requests must be sent to other actors in the course of processing a request, the code can become quite
    muddled by the use of anonymous classes used to implement the callbacks for processing the responses of those
    requests. ...

1.  [JActor Factories](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/jactor/entry/jactor_factories4)

    The JAFactory actor binds actor type names to actor factories, allowing type names to be used in place of class
    names for serialization/deserialization. ...
